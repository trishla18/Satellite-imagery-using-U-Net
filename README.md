# Satellite-imagery-using-U-Net
- In this project, we are implementing a deep learning-based image segmentation system using a U-Net model. The primary goal is to automatically segment different classes of objects within images, such as buildings, roads, vegetation, etc.
- Implemented a multi-level U-Net model with Dice Loss and Categorical Focal Loss for accurate pixel classification.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy and Jaccard Index (IoU).
